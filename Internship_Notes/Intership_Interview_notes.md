**Hackathon - Get Lucky 3000:**

- Tech Stack:

=> HTML / CSS / JavaScript

- Description:

Through the Coder Academy bootcamp, I was able to participate in my first hackathon. Within a timeframe of 36 hours, teams had to develop a web application utilising any API of their choice. Get Lucky 3000 is a web application that creates a dating profile based on the information provided by the user. The app constructs the user's dream dating profile by utilising the following APIs: Affirmations, Corporate BS Generator, Dad Jokes and the Dog API.

- Challenges:

The primary challenge of this project was designing and developing the application within a short timeframe. This was achieved by utilising each members strengths to not only maximise the teams efficiency but develop a product that met user expectations and requirements.

**Workout Jungle:**

- Tech Stack:

=> Ruby on Rails / PostreSQL / HTML / Bootstrap Framework / Heroku / Cloudinary / Trello / Balsamiq

- Description:

Workout Jungle is a two-sided marketplace in which Australian consumers can buy and sell new and used fitness equipment. Workout Jungle was my first full-stack application as it utilised a variety of languages, frameworks, third-party services and a relational database.

- Challenges:

Workout Jungle allowed me to experience the development of a full-stack application through an agile based development process. This forced me to construct the web application and its features within various sprints. The project was deployed continuously on Heroku which challenged me to refine my knowledge and skills with Git branching, while working with development and production pipelines. Workout Jungle allowed me to build a relational database for the applications users and listings, which was an amazing experience while challenging at the same time.

**Zop Ruby Quiz Game:**

- Tech Stack:

=> Ruby / Trello / Balsamiq

- Description:

Zop is a terminal based quiz game build completely with Ruby. Zop will prompt a player with a serious of random questions ranging in difficulty, while tracking their current score and attempts remaining.

- Challenges:

This project challenged me to focus on test driven development and error handling as a developer. It also allowed me to refine writing more DRY and clean code, within a logic based program and construct detailed documentation alongside it.

**Portfolio:**

- Tech Stack:

=> HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Trello / Balsamiq

- Description:

My first project at Coder Academy allowed me to demonstrate my skills as a developer alongside utilising my knowledge and the technologies at my disposal in designing and creating a portfolio.

- Challenges:

As a developer, I was challenged to focus heavily on mobile first design while creating a website that was engaging, assessable and secure.
